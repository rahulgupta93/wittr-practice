# wittr-practice

This Wittr project is a practice project created to display posts/feeds like in twitter.

It contains multiple practice projects - each in its own directory - all of which are derived from the basic project (in basic directory).

It contains following projects:

1) basic [COMPLETED] -> The most basic layout for displaying feeds and tweets using plain html, css and javascript.

2) responsive-design [INCOMPLETE] -> Basic project is copied and then responsive design is implemented to this project using mobile first approach.

3) offline-first [INCOMPLETE] -> Use service workers to cache (html, css, js) files. Similarly, use indexed DB to store the reponses from request. The aim is to improve the offline/slow wifi/liefi experience.

4) build-tools [INCOMPLETE] -> Use build tools, ts, scss to revamp the project and divide the files in chunks.

5) optimize-performance [INCOMPLETE] -> Use the concept of critical rendering path to improve the page load speed.
